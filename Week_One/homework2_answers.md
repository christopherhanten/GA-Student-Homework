Part 1 - Github
1. git init
2. add (git add "filename")
3. commit (git commit -m "informative message about the commit")

1. git pull origin master
2. git reset
3. git checkout
4. I do not know the answer to this question (maybe it delineates that the action is in the past?)
5. Because you created an error in the file that you most recently committed or committed the wrong file.
