Part 1 - Github
1. git init
2. add (git add "filename")
3. commit (git commit -m "informative message about the commit")

1. git pull origin master
2. git reset
3. git checkout
4. I do not know the answer to this question (maybe it delineates that the action is in the past?)
5. Because you created an error in the file that you most recently committed or committed the wrong file.

1. git branch branch name
2. git checkout branch filename
3. You'd use a branch other than master to work on an individual feature or do a bug fix.

1. You'd use git merge when someone has checked out code. made additions/changes, and submitted a pull request. You'd verify that the code looks good and merge it.
2. git push origin master.
